Actually, ZK supports few types of charts based on JFreeChart library.\r\nIn this small talk, I will introduce a new component, the ZHighCharts, based on Highcharts JS library. The ZHighCharts component offers an easy way for a person to create modern and intuitive charts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\nZHighCharts demonstrations are available on this link: [http://zhighcharts.appspot.com/demo.zul](http://zhighcharts.appspot.com/demo.zul)\r\n\r\n### Component Usage\r\n\r\nTo create a chart, four steps are required:\r\n1. Add zhighcharts-0.1.1.jar to the directory WEB-INF/lib\r\n2. Add the ZHighCharts component to the ZUL file\r\n> <zhighcharts id=\"chartComp\" />\r\n3. Initialize and configure the component in the controller \r\n> ZHighCharts chartComp;\r\n\r\n> chartComp = (ZHighCharts) getFellow(\"chartComp\");\r\n> chartComp.setTitle(\"My first ZHighChart chart\");\r\n> chartComp.setType(\"line\");\r\n4. Add some data\r\n> SimpleExtXYModel dataChartModel = new SimpleExtXYModel();\r\n\r\n> chartComp.setModel(dataChartModel);\r\n\r\n> dataChartModel.addValue(\"Chart 1\", 0, 7);\r\n> dataChartModel.addValue(\"Chart 1\", 1, 4);\r\n> dataChartModel.addValue(\"Chart 1\", 2, 9);\r\n> dataChartModel.addValue(\"Chart 1\", 3, 5);\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nTo use ZHighCharts, a valid Highcharts license is required. \r\nNote the use of Highcharts is **free **for non-profit organizations, students, universities, public schools and non-commercial personal websites.\r\nMore informations are available on this link: [http://shop.highsoft.com/highcharts.html](http://shop.highsoft.com/highcharts.html).\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nHighCharts JS is considered as one of the best charting library written in JavaScript. The ZHighCharts project is trying to provide a pure Java approach to use HighCharts JS on ZK projects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
